COMP 4610 – GUI I
HW5 – Scrabble Drag & Drop

All core gameplay features are fully working. The board is made up of individual drop target squares, both normal and Double Letter and Double Word bonus squares, arranged in a single row.
When a tile is dropped onto a square, the program correctly identifies which square it is and applies the proper scoring rules. The total score is updated accurately after each word is played, and letter bonuses are applied prior to word bonuses.
Tiles must be placed adjacent to one another for a word to be accepted, and invalid placements are rejected.

The board is cleared and fresh tiles are dealt to bring the rack back to seven tiles after a word is played.  Until the user decides to restart the game, the total score is maintained throughout several rounds.
The user can start a new game at any time by using the restart button, which resets the board, score, and tile distribution.  Tiles are always visible and appropriately layered during interaction, and drag and drop behavior is consistent.
